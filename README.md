# CVT_COVID-CT-CNN
Collaboration space/data storage for development of a COVID CT CNN by CVT
Please note:
1. TrainingTXT, ValidationTXT, and TestingTXT folders contain txt files indicating which images were used by UCSD researchers (we may or may not decide to divide the images this way)
2. Meta folder contains data about each CT image (i.e. patient id, sex, age, stage of disease, origin, pathological annotation)
3. CT_COVID.zip and CT_NonCOVID.zip contain the same CT images as the CT_COVID and CT_NonCOVID folders
